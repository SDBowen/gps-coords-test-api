# Circle GPS Test Data API

Developed to send coordinate data to Circle GPS for test and demo purposes.

Current bus and train coordinates are pulled from the Chicago Transit Authority public API. A unique ID is attached to each bus or train coordinate pair, and the package is sent to the Circle GPS API.
